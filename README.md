# DATA-ANALYST-PORTFOLIO

Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio. My name is Amal Boukhris and I am excited to have you here!

This portfolio contains a variety of projects that demonstrate my skills in data analysis. You will find links to the dashboards and reports that I have created using a variety of tools such as Power BI, Tableau, and Excel. These projects demonstrate my ability to analyze data and present it in a clear and visually appealing way, making it easy for decision makers to understand the insights and take action on them.

I have also used programming languages such as SQL and Python, in order to demonstrate my skills in extracting valuable insights from large and complex datasets, and in combining data from multiple sources into one comprehensive view.
